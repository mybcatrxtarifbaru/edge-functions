### denostd http/cookie.ts

This is a subset of the Deno Standard library. We use this to provide https://deno.land/std@0.114.0/http/cookie.ts dependencies. The http/cookie.ts dependency is not yet available in available npm modules like [@tybys/denostd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tybys/denostd/v/0.100.10000) and this is how we make it available to Edge Functions node types.
